		<h1>Nintendo Goal: Bringing Smiles to People's Faces</h1>
		<article>
			<p>Nintendo was founded in 1899 in Kyoto, Japan. Back then, the company mainly produced "Hanafuda" – traditional Japanese playing cards. The 1970s marked the start of our video game development and manufacture, and thus the beginning of a new chapter of our company's history.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has been producing video game systems and games for over 40 years, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Wii and Nintendo 3DS family systems. In 2017, our decades of gaming experience came together in one console – Nintendo Switch: a system that can transform to suit your situation, allowing you to enjoy games anytime, anywhere, with anyone.</p>
			<p>Over the years, Nintendo has sold more than 4.5 billion video games and more than 710 million hardware units. This is thanks to the iconic characters that Nintendo has created, among them Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Link and Princess Zelda, Pokémon, the Inklings and many more.</p>
